Selenium Script Results Web App
This web app allows users to run a script that fetches trending topics, the timestamp of the data, and the IP address used for the query. The data is presented in a formatted view, including a JSON extract from a MongoDB database. The user can run the script and view the results or run it again to fetch updated data.

Features
Fetch trending topics in real-time.
Display the timestamp of when the data was fetched.
Show the IP address used for the query.
Display a formatted JSON extract from MongoDB.
Re-run the query by clicking the "Run again" button.
Simple and responsive design.
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Node.js (with npm or yarn)
MongoDB (if you plan to connect to a local MongoDB database)
Express.js (for backend API, used in the /run-script endpoint)
Selenium (for web scraping or automation tasks)

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-script-results-web-app.git
cd selenium-script-results-web-app

2. Install Dependencies
Install backend dependencies using npm or yarn.
npm install
# or
yarn install

3. Set Up Backend API
The backend needs to expose an endpoint (/run-script) that will run the Selenium script and return the data as a JSON object. You should modify this endpoint to fit your use case (e.g., interacting with a database or scraping a website).

4. Run the Application
To start the backend server, use:
npm start
# or
yarn start

Backend Endpoint
/run-script
This endpoint is responsible for running the script (using Selenium or any other logic) and returning a JSON object with the results.

Response Example:
{
  "data": {
    "trends": {
      "0": "Trend 1",
      "1": "Trend 2",
      "2": "Trend 3"
    },
    "datetime": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
    "_id": "12345",
    "proxyIPAddress": "192.168.1.2"
  }
}

JSON Fields:
trends: An object containing the trending topics.
datetime: The timestamp when the data was fetched.
ipAddress: The IP address used for the query.
_id: The MongoDB document ID.
proxyIPAddress: The proxy IP address (if any).

Running the Project
Start the Backend: Run the server with npm start or yarn start.
Access the Frontend: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You will see the "Click here to run the script" link.
Fetch Data: Click the link to fetch the data and see the results. You can also click "Run again" to re-fetch the data
